Include Handlebars Templates for Rocket Framework
====================

This is a crate which provides macros `handlebars_resources_initialize!` and `handlebars_response!` to statically include HBS (Handlebars) files from your Rust project and make them be the HTTP response sources quickly.

## Example

```rust
#![feature(plugin)]
#![plugin(rocket_codegen)]

#[macro_use] extern crate lazy_static;

#[macro_use] extern crate rocket_include_static_resources;
extern crate rocket_etag_if_none_match;

extern crate rocket;
extern crate crc;
extern crate mime_guess;

static_resources_initialize!(
   "favicon", "included-static-resources/favicon.ico",
   "favicon-png", "included-static-resources/favicon-16.png"
);

use rocket_etag_if_none_match::EtagIfNoneMatch;

use rocket::response::Response;

#[get("/favicon.ico")]
fn favicon(etag_if_none_match: EtagIfNoneMatch) -> Response<'static> {
   static_response!(etag_if_none_match, "favicon")
}

#[get("/favicon.png")]
fn favicon_png() -> Response<'static> {
   static_response!("favicon-png")
}
```

* `static_resources_initialize!` is used for including files into your executable binary file. You need to specify each file's ID and its path. For instance, the above example uses **favicon** to represent the file **included-static-resources/favicon.ico** and **favicon_png** to represent the file **included-static-resources/favicon.png**. An ID cannot be repeating.
* `static_response!` is used for retrieving the file you input through the macro `static_resources_initialize!` as a Response instance into which three HTTP headers, **Content-Type**, **Content-Length** and **Etag**, will be automatically added.

Refer to `tests/favicon.rs` to see the example completely.
